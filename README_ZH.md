# RosMqttBridge

这个项目的目的是通过MQTT桥梁建立本地主机和IoT设备之间的双向通信。我们使用的IoT设备集成了ROS系统，并配备了一个摄像头，可以拍摄点云和图像数据。启用算法后，该设备可以处理这些数据并将其发布到本地ROS话题上。此设备还可以通过网络传输数据。由于IoT设备和本地主机的公网IP地址不确定，且需要传输大量数据，而且有的场景下网络环境不稳定，因此我们选择使用MQTT协议来实现它们的远距离数据传输。


Based on the code you provided, it seems that the image transfer and point cloud transfer are running in the main thread, which means that they will block the main thread until they finish. In general, it is a good practice to run long-running tasks, such as network I/O and file I/O, in a separate thread or process so that they do not block the main thread and cause the program to become unresponsive.

Therefore, it might be a good idea to start the image transfer and point cloud transfer in separate threads. You can use the threading module in Python to create threads. Here's an example of how you can start the image transfer and point cloud transfer in separate threads:
